# EOSS
Open-Source shader script for Plane Crazy

# Introduction
Have you seen all of these youtubers with their fancy shaders? You most likely have, and wanted to use their shaders aswell.
However, these shaders aren't publically avalible; the creators are stingy of their scripts and dont want to share them with the public.

EOSS aims to provide the same quality as these shaders, but free for anyone to use.
